# resume

Literally just my resume.

## About

I want a separate place to host my resume so I can link to it via a subdomain.

Also taking this opportunity to be amazed at just how many files are needed for a "favicon" in 2021. Lol.

## Development

If you'd like your own resume website, do four things:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Replace `resume.pdf` with your own (and the favicon files).
3. Push to GitHub.
4. Add a CNAME with your website's subdomain.

To get the subdomain to fully work, check out [this](https://anmonteiro.com/2015/08/custom-subdomains-in-github-project-pages/) link.

Hope this helps!
